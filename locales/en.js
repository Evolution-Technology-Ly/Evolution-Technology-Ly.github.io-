We exist to be the opposite of that."},{"title":"Our Conviction","body":"Enterprise systems are critical infrastructure. They carry business logic accumulated over years, support thousands of users, and underpin strategic decision-making. They deserve the same rigour applied to building bridges — not the same shortcuts applied to building demos."},{"title":"The Long Game","body":"We measure success in years. A system that works perfectly at launch but becomes unmaintainable in three years is a failure.
