<!-- Philosophy -->
<section class="et-section">
    <div class="container">
        <span class="et-label">Company Philosophy</span>

        <div class="et-philosophy-block">
            <h2 class="et-detail-title">Engineering-First Practice</h2>
            <p class="et-detail-body">
                We operate as a technical engineering practice. Our work is defined by methodical analysis,
                structured design, and disciplined execution. We do not offer generic solutions or apply
                pre-packaged methodologies without assessment.
            </p>
            <p class="et-detail-body">
                Each engagement begins with a thorough assessment of the client's technical environment,
                constraints, and objectives. Recommendations are grounded in that assessment — not in
                vendor preferences or default frameworks.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="et-philosophy-block">
            <h2 class="et-detail-title">Architectural Thinking</h2>
            <p class="et-detail-body">
                Our approach to every project begins at the architectural level. We assess constraints,
                define requirements formally, and design systems that are fit for purpose. We do not
                begin development before architecture is sufficiently defined and reviewed.
            </p>
            <p class="et-detail-body">
                This discipline prevents the compounding technical debt that results from premature
                implementation and inadequately designed system boundaries.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="et-philosophy-block">
            <h2 class="et-detail-title">Long-Term Technical Partnership</h2>
            <p class="et-detail-body">
                Clients engage us because they require more than a development vendor. They require a
                technical partner who understands their systems in depth, who can provide continuity
                across projects, and who remains accountable after delivery.
            </p>
            <p class="et-detail-body">
                We do not optimize for project throughput. We optimize for system quality and the
                durability of our client relationships. A long-term engagement with a single
                well-understood client is of greater value to us than multiple brief engagements.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="et-philosophy-block">
            <h2 class="et-detail-title">Structured Delivery</h2>
            <p class="et-detail-body">
                Every engagement produces documented, reviewable, and traceable artifacts. Scope is
                defined before work begins. Progress is measurable. Deliverables are specified in
                advance. There is no ambiguity in what we are building or why.
