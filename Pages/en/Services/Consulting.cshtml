                Technical decisions made without adequate independent review carry compounding
                risk. Whether evaluating a proposed architecture, assessing the quality of a
                system under active development, or preparing for a major technology transition,
                an independent technical perspective provides the objectivity that internal
                teams cannot provide for their own work.

            <p class="et-detail-body">
                Our consulting engagements produce structured, documented findings — not verbal
                opinions. Every recommendation is grounded in observed evidence, stated
                assumptions, and traceable reasoning.

                Available as a <strong>fixed-scope technical assessment</strong> with a defined
                deliverable set and completion timeline, or as a <strong>retained advisory
                engagement</strong> for organizations requiring ongoing independent technical
                oversight across a program or portfolio. The fixed-scope model is appropriate
                for one-time audits and due diligence exercises. The retained model suits
                organizations undergoing sustained technical change who require consistent
                independent review.
