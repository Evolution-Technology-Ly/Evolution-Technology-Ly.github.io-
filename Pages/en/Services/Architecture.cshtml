            Designing the structural foundation of complex software systems. Architectural integrity
            determines long-term operability, scalability, and maintainability. We approach every
            architecture engagement with formal rigor and documented reasoning.

            <p class="et-detail-body">
                Sound architecture is the foundation of every reliable system. Poor architectural decisions
                create compounding technical debt that becomes increasingly expensive to resolve over time.
                We provide architectural services for organizations building new systems, extending existing
                platforms, or evaluating their current technical foundations.
            </p>
            <p class="et-detail-body">
                Our architectural work is grounded in formal methods: documented decision records,
                explicit trade-off analysis, and validation against stated requirements. We do not
                produce architecture as a theoretical exercise — every design decision is justified,
                traceable, and aligned to operational constraints.

                This service is available as a <strong>fixed-scope architecture assessment</strong> for
                organizations requiring an independent review of an existing or proposed system design,
                or as an <strong>extended architecture lead</strong> engagement where we provide
                ongoing architectural oversight across a development program. Both models begin with a
                scoping session to define the engagement boundary and expected deliverables.
